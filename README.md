## Features

- **Streamlit for GUI**: Utilizes the Streamlit framework to provide a simple and intuitive user interface.
- **Dropbox for Storage**: Uses Dropbox to save text files generated by the application, ensuring messages are securely stored and easily retrievable.
- **Message Sharing**: Users can write and save messages which will be automatically appended to the website, making them visible to all visitors.

## How It Works

1. **Write a Message**: Users can input their messages, thoughts, or stories into the web application.
2. **Save the Message**: Upon saving, the message is stored in a text file on Dropbox.
3. **Automatic Appending**: The saved message is automatically appended to the web page, making it visible to all users who visit the site.
4. **Shared Platform**: All visitors can view the collective messages, creating a shared space for thoughts and memories.
